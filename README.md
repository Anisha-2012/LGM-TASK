This is the second task of my web development internship at Letsgrowmore Community
CREATE A WEB APPLICATION USING CREATE-REACT

Hello everyone!
This is the second task of my web development internship at Letsgrowmore Community. Herein I have created a user card grid having a navbar showing the brand name "TRAVELO". Also I have added a button "GET USER" which makes an API call to get user data. Also I have used CSS to style and make it more attractive.
I explored various concepts and fundamentals of web development by designing this web application using react. This task helped me to enrich my knowledge and skills in web development. Meanwhile, this internship turned out to be a great part of my learning process and an add on to my practical skills by getting my hands into coding.
Also, I would like to thank Letsgrowmore community for this marvellous opportunity.
